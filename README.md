# AWS-Udacity-Capstone-Project(Arvato Project)
#### Summary

The objective of this project is to analyze the data collected by the company in order to optimize the mailing campaigns performed for their customers. The project also helps Arvato see who is likely to be a customer through clustering and comparison of the general public and existing customers.

This project consisted of 3 main steps:

1. Data exploration and cleaning.
2. Clustering. This helped Arvato  check out how the population characteristics compare to the existing customer characteristics.
3. Customer conversion through supervised learning, to predict how likely a typical person in the population is likely to convert to a customer.
4. Medium Report explaining the project. You can find the medium article here [Medium article](https://mukamikareko.medium.com/arvato-project-customer-segmentation-using-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-e6ff18ae7c64)
